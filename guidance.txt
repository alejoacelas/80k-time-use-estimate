# ATUS Data Processing Reference for Time Use by Activity Group

## Files You'll Need

**Activity Summary File** is your primary file—it contains total minutes per activity per respondent in a single row per person. Variables starting with lowercase "t" (e.g., `t010101`) hold total minutes for each 6-digit activity code.

**Respondent File** contains demographics, employment status, and survey weights. Can be merged with Activity Summary via `TUCASEID`.

## Key Variables

### Identifying Full-Time Workers
| Variable | Description | Values |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `TELFS` | Labor force status | 1 = Employed at work, 2 = Employed absent |
| `TRDPFTPT` | Full-time/part-time status | 1 = Full time, 2 = Part time |

**Filter**: `TELFS IN (1,2) AND TRDPFTPT = 1`

### Weekday vs Weekend
| Variable | Description | Values |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `TUDIARYDAY` | Day of diary day | 1=Sun, 2=Mon, 3=Tue, 4=Wed, 5=Thu, 6=Fri, 7=Sat |

**Weekday**: `TUDIARYDAY IN (2,3,4,5,6)`  
**Weekend**: `TUDIARYDAY IN (1,7)`

### Survey Weight
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TUFINLWGT` | ATUS final weight (required for population estimates) |

## Activity Code Structure

Activities use 6-digit codes combining three tiers:
- **Tier 1** (digits 1-2): Major category (01-50)
- **Tier 2** (digits 3-4): Subcategory
- **Tier 3** (digits 5-6): Detailed activity

The **Activity Lexicon** (www.bls.gov/tus/lexicons/lexiconwex2024.pdf) defines all codes. Common major categories:

| Tier 1 | Category |
|--------|----------|
| 01 | Personal Care (includes sleep: 0101xx) |
| 02 | Household Activities |
| 03 | Caring for Household Members |
| 05 | Work & Work-Related |
| 06 | Education |
| 12 | Socializing, Relaxing, Leisure |
| 13 | Sports, Exercise, Recreation |
| 15 | Volunteer Activities |
| 18 | Travel |

## Computing Time by Activity Group

In the Activity Summary file, sum the relevant `t######` variables. For example:
- **Sleep**: `t010101` (sleeping) + `t010102` (sleeplessness)
- **Work**: Sum all `t05####` variables
- **Leisure**: Sum all `t12####` and `t13####` variables

Each value is in **minutes**. Divide by 60 for hours.

---

## Weighted Mean Calculation

```
Weighted Average = Σ(TUFINLWGT × minutes) / Σ(TUFINLWGT)
```

Apply this separately for weekday and weekend subsamples.

---

## Missing Values

Standard missing codes across variables:
- `-1` = Blank
- `-2` = Don't know
- `-3` = Refused

Exclude these from calculations.


## Potential Issues in ATUS Time Use Estimation

### 1. Weekend Oversampling — **NEEDS CORRECTION (if computing overall average)**

ATUS deliberately samples weekend days and weekday days at roughly equal rates (≈50/50), but real weeks have 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

**If computing weekday and weekend averages separately**: No correction needed—you're stratifying anyway.

**If computing a single "average day" estimate**: Weight the results:
```
Overall = (5/7 × weekday_avg) + (2/7 × weekend_avg)
```

---

### 2. Survey Weights (TUFINLWGT) — **MUST USE**

The weights correct for:
- Probability of selection (some households more likely to be sampled)
- Non-response (certain demographics respond at different rates)
- Post-stratification to Census population totals

Without weights, your estimates won't represent the US population—they'll just describe ATUS respondents.

---

### 7. CPS-to-ATUS Lag — **POTENTIAL ISSUE FOR EMPLOYMENT STATUS**

Employment variables come from CPS interviews conducted 2-5 months before the ATUS diary day. Someone classified as full-time employed may have changed status by the diary day.

`TRERNUPD = 1` indicates earnings were updated in ATUS. No equivalent flag exists for employment status changes, but this affects a small fraction of cases.

## Summary Table

| Issue | Correction Needed? | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Weekend oversampling | **Yes** (for overall average) | 5/7 weekday + 2/7 weekend |
| Survey weights | **Yes, always** | Use `TUFINLWGT` |
| Holidays | Maybe | Depends on research question |
| Seasonality | No | Built into annual weights |
| Allocated values | Rarely | Check if precision-critical |
| Single-day design | No | Population estimates still valid |
| Employment status lag | Minor | Small percentage affected |
| Age topcoding | No | Irrelevant for working-age sample |
